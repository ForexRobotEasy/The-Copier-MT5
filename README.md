# The Copier MT5 ReadMe

## Program Description
The Copier MT5 is a trade copying software that allows users to copy trades from one MetaTrader 4 (MT4) or MetaTrader 5 (MT5) terminal to another. It provides functionality to copy trades between different terminals and platforms, such as MT4 to MT5, MT5 to MT4, MT4 to another MT4 terminal, and MT5 to another MT5 terminal.

This code demonstrates how the trade copying functions work in the program. It includes four main trade copying functions for different copying scenarios, namely:
1. CopyFromMT4toMT5: Copies trades from MT4 to MT5 terminal.
2. CopyFromMT5toMT4: Copies trades from MT5 to MT4 terminal.
3. CopyFromMT4toMT4: Copies trades from one MT4 terminal to another.
4. CopyFromMT5toMT5: Copies trades from one MT5 terminal to another.

These functions retrieve trade details such as price, lot size, and order type from the source terminal and use the OrderSend function to place the same trade on the target terminal. They also include error handling to check if the trade copying was successful or not.

The main function, OnTick, checks if trade copying is allowed and calls the respective trade copying functions. The OnInit function initializes the trade copying settings, and the OnDeinit function is used for program termination and cleanup.
